SAC_2014_App
============

Rowan's mobile app for SAC

###To-Do
* Get user location, pass it to system, get results
* Notifications
* Maintain current web state even when the device orientation changes. Right now it goes home.
* Fix upload UI
* Maintain current state when device orientation changes in upload
* New icons for dialog

### Done
* camera integration and autoupload
* Fix styles for Jelly Bean and below (right now we use padding to color in the system bar. That will lead to a very high action bar on a JB device)
* Use one menu item to both upload and camera
